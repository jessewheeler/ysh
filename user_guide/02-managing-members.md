# Managing Members

## Member List

Navigate to **Members** in the sidebar. The list displays 25 members per page and can be searched by name, email, or member number using the search bar at the top.

Each row shows the member's name, email, member number, status, and join date.

## Member Statuses

| Status        | Meaning                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Pending**   | Signed up but payment has not been completed    |
| **Active**    | Payment confirmed; full member in good standing |
| **Expired**   | Membership period has lapsed                    |
| **Cancelled** | Membership was manually cancelled by an admin   |

## Adding a Member

1. Click **Add Member** on the members list page.
2. Fill in the required fields: first name, last name, and email.
3. A member number in the format `YSH-YYYY-NNNN` is generated automatically.
4. Set the initial status (defaults to pending).
5. Click **Save**.

## Editing a Member

1. Click a member's name in the list to open their detail page.
2. Update any fields and click **Save**.
3. You can change status here — for example, marking a member as expired or cancelled.

## Member Detail Page

The detail view includes three additional panels beyond the edit form:

- **Payment History** — all payments linked to this member
- **Membership Cards** — previously generated cards available for download
- **Email Log** — every email sent to this member

## Searching

Type a query into the search bar and press Enter. The search matches against:

- First and last name
- Email address
- Member number (e.g., `YSH-2026-0012`)

Clear the search field and press Enter to return to the full list.
